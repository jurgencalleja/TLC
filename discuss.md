# /tdd:discuss - Discuss Phase Implementation

Capture your implementation preferences before planning.

## What This Does

Calls `/gsd:discuss-phase` — no TDD-specific logic needed here.

## Usage

```
/tdd:discuss [phase_number]
```

## Example

```
/tdd:discuss 1
```

This is where you shape HOW the phase gets built — layout preferences, interaction patterns, error handling approaches, etc. The output feeds into planning and test writing.
