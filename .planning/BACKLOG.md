# Test Backlog

## High Priority

- [x] `dashboard/src/App.tsx` - Main app component with pane switching, keyboard navigation, task assignment callbacks

## Standard

- [ ] `bin/install.js` - CLI installer with interactive prompts, file copying, directory detection

## Low Priority (Trivial)

- [ ] `dashboard/src/index.tsx` - Entry point (single render call, may not need tests)
