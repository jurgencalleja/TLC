# /tlc:server - TLC Development Server

**This command is deprecated. Use `/tlc:start` instead.**

## Instructions for Claude

Tell the user:

```
/tlc:server has been replaced by /tlc:start

Run /tlc:start to choose:
  1) TLC Environment - Dashboard + your app (fast, simple)
  2) Full Production - Docker containers (database, redis, etc.)

Starting /tlc:start for you...
```

Then immediately run `/tlc:start` (invoke the Skill tool with skill="tlc:start").
