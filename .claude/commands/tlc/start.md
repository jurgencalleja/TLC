# /tlc:start - Start TLC Dev Server

Start the Docker development environment.

## Instructions for Claude

Check which launcher exists and run the appropriate one:

**On Mac/Linux (or WSL):**
```bash
./tlc-start.sh
```

**On Windows (CMD/PowerShell):**
```cmd
tlc-start.bat
```

If neither file exists, tell the user:
```
No launcher found. Run 'tlc init' first.
```

**Don't analyze the codebase. Just run the launcher.**
